The traditional chronological resume lists your work experience in reverse-chronological order (starting with your current or most recent position). The functional style deemphasizes the "where" and "when" of your career and instead of groups similar experiences, talents, and qualifications regardless of when they occurred.  

Like the chronological resume, the hybrid resume includes specifics about where you worked, when you worked there, and what your job titles were.
